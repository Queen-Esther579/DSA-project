PALMORIA PROJECT REVIEW

Gender Equality Overview
Key Finding
1. PalmorIa’s overall gender distribution shows a moderate imbalance, with women representing approximately 40% of the workforce and men 60%.
2. Gender pay gap: The analysis revealed a significant pay gap between men and women, with women earning up to 20% less than men in similar positions.
3. Regional differences: Regional disparities in salary and benefits were identified, with certain regions experiencing more pronounced pay gaps than others.
4. Compliance with regulations: The analysis highlighted instances of non-compliance with regulations, including inadequate reporting and lack of transparency in pay practices.
5. Root causes: The session identified several root causes, including:
    - Bias in hiring and promotion practices
    - Lack of transparency in pay practices
    - Limited opportunities for career advancement- Regional economic and cultural factors

The imbalance widens in job roles, where women occupy only 25–30% of positions, highlighting a potential glass ceiling.

Some non-technical and administrative departments show near parity, demonstrating progress but underscoring the need for targeted initiatives in technical and all job positions.

Regional Disparities
Analysis by region (Southwest, Northwest, and North-Central) reveals stark differences:
The Southwest region has the highest female representation (close to 45%) and stronger salary equity metrics.
The Northwest is behind, with female representation below 35% and wider pay gaps, suggesting cultural or systemic barriers.
The North-Central region shows moderate gender representation but notable salary inconsistencies.
Regional variations suggest that deliberate, region-specific strategies are essential to address local dynamics affecting gender equality.

Salary Gap Analysis
Company-wide, the average salary for men exceeds that for women by 10–15%, even when controlling for experience and job level.
This gap is most pronounced in roles and salaries. Male employees earn on average 20% more than their female counterparts.

Salary band analysis indicates clustering of women in mid-salary bands, with limited upward mobility.
By region, the Northwest shows the widest gender salary gap, while the Southwest has the narrowest.

 Compliance with Regulations
Palmoria demonstrates partial compliance with equal pay and workplace diversity regulations:

While pay policies nominally follow equal pay guidelines, actual salary distributions show inconsistencies inconsistent with full compliance.

Regional salary band structures sometimes fail to meet statutory benchmarks for pay parity and fair promotion practices.

Recommendations
1. Implement transparent pay practices: Develop and implement transparent pay practices, including regular reporting and disclosure of pay data.
2. Training and education: Provide training and education on unconscious bias, diversity, and inclusion to promote fair hiring and promotion practices.
3. Career development opportunities: Offer career development opportunities and mentorship programs to support women's career advancement.
4. Regional initiatives: Develop regional initiatives to address regional disparities in salary and benefits.
5. Compliance monitoring: Establish a compliance monitoring system to ensure adherence to regulations and promote transparency.
6. Salary Audits: Conduct annual, independent pay equity audits; adjust compensation structures to ensure salaries are based strictly on performance, experience, and role requirements not gender.
7. Compliance Measures: Strengthen Human Resource recordkeeping and adopt proactive diversity reporting to fully align with equal pay and anti-discrimination regulations.

Future Directions
1. Data analysis: Conduct regular data analysis to monitor progress and identify areas for improvement.
2. Stakeholder engagement: Engage with stakeholders, including employees, management, and regulatory bodies, to promote awareness and compliance.
3. Policy development: Develop and implement policies that promote gender equality, fairness, and transparency in pay practices.

 Conclusion
Palmoria’s workforce analysis highlights both achievements and challenges in promoting gender equality. Addressing regional disparities, closing salary gaps, and strengthening compliance efforts will not only improve fairness but also enhance company reputation, revenue generation, employee engagement, and long-term competitiveness.

AMAZON PROJECT REVIEW


This report analyzes Amazon’s product catalog to uncover key insights on pricing, ratings, discounting trends, and category-level performance. These findings enable informed decisions on pricing strategies, promotional planning, and product optimization.

Key Insight: Majority of best-selling products fall in the $50–$150 range, indicating strong consumer interest in affordable yet premium-quality items.
The average actual price across all products is significantly higher than the average discounted price, indicating aggressive discounting strategies to attract customers.

Price segmentation reveals that a large share of products fall within the mid-tier range of ₹200–₹500, but substantial inventory also exists in both budget (<₹200) and premium (>₹500) segments.

Category-level analysis shows that certain categories — such as Electronics and Home Appliances — dominate the high-price brackets, while categories like Clothing and Accessories are heavily skewed toward lower price ranges.

 Discount Patterns

A substantial portion of the catalog offers discounts exceeding 50%, with certain products discounted as much as 90%.

Categories with the highest maximum discounts include Clothing, Electronics, and Home; indicating these segments use deep discounts as a primary sales driver.

Analysis of average discounts by category suggests that price-sensitive categories tend to have steeper average markdowns, whereas premium segments offer selective discounts to maintain perceived value.
